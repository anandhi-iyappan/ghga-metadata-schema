Before you start, please refer to the Code of Conduct . By participating, you are expected to uphold its principles. The GHGA Metadata Schema is authored using the LinkML framework. For contributors who are interested in improving the schema it would be good to first familiarize yourself with LinkML. There is a quick start guide available here . Requesting or suggesting changes to the metadata schema \u00b6 To request or suggest a change to the schema, first make sure you capture all information required to incorporate the change or to facilitate a discussion which can then translate to changes that can be incorporated into the schema. Please make use of one of the GitHub Issue Templates to make a request via the GitHub Issue Tracker. Modifying the metadata schema \u00b6 To add your contributions to the schema, we recomend using GitHub Fork and Pull workflow which involves the following principles: Principle 1: Work from a personal fork Prior to adopting the workflow, a developer will perform a one-time setup to create a personal fork of the ghga-de/ghga-metadata-schema repository. This forked repository will be associated with the developer's GitHub account, and is distinct from the main (upstream) repository. Principle 2: Commit to personal branches of that fork Changes should never be committed directly to the main or the dev branch of the main repository. Instead, they should be composed as branches within the developer's forked repository, where the developer can interate and refine their code prior to submitting it for review. The name of the branch should reflect a GitHub issue ticket (For example, issue-123 ). Principle 3: Propose changes via pull request of personal branches Each set of changes will be developed in a task-specific branch in the developer's forked repository, and then a pull request will be created to develop and propose changes to the dev branch of the main repository. Also, tag the maintainers to the PR for review. This mechanism provides a way for developers to discuss, revise, and ultimately merge changes from the forked repository to the main repository. Principle 4: Delete or ignore stale branches, but don't recycle merged ones Once a pull request has been merged, the task-specific branch is no longer needed and may be deleted or ignored. It is bad practice to reuse an existing branch once it has been merged. Instead, a subsequent branch and pull-request cycle should begin if there are more additions to be made, after the PR has been merged. You may create a pull request in order to get feedback, but if you wish to continue working on the branch, so state with \"DO NOT MERGE YET\" in the PR title OR mark the pull request as a Draft OR label the pull request with a 'Do Not Merge' label. TL;DR Fork the ghga-de/ghga-metadata-schema repository Create a new branch off of dev branch where the name of the new branch reflects the issue ticket (for example, issue-123 ) Make the desired changes to the YAML Commit the changes Issue a new PR from your new branch to the dev branch Tag the maintainers for a PR review Do not recycle merged branches Note: Please do not commit changes to the files in the artifacts folder.

This quickstart guide will provide a brief description of commonly used LinkML slots to define various aspects of the GHGA Metadata Schema. Please refer to LinkML documentation for an exhaustive list of slots provided by the modeling language. Inheritance Related Slots \u00b6 is_a \u00b6 The is_a slot can be used to define a hierarchy for your class, mixin or slot where a new class, mixin or slot is defined as a subclass of another defined class, mixin or slot. Note that is_a has the characteristics of homeomorphicity. i.e. is_a should be used to connect, two mixins two classes two slots abstract \u00b6 A class (or slot) may be tagged with its abstract slot set to the boolean value true , to define whether it is abstract in nature. This has comparable meaning to that in the Object Oriented Programming where another class can use the abstract class as part of its inheritance hierarchy, but the abstract class itself cannot be directly instantiated. mixin \u00b6 The mixin:true declaration is used to extend the properties (or slots) of a class, without changing its position in the class hierarchy. Mixins can be extremely helpful in a number of ways: to generalize a set of attributes that can apply to classes in different parts of the class hierarchy to reduce duplication of shared attributes between classes that do not inherit from one another to prevent the sometimes confusing nature of multiple inheritance noted in the diamond problem Mixins provide the means for reusing semantics, generally by the inclusion of specific property slots or other semantic constraint, in different classes or slots, without the need to tie slots to the hierarchy of the class itself. mixins \u00b6 The mixins slot (not to be confused with mixin ) can be used to specify a list of mixins that a class (or slot) can use to include the added semantics of the mixins. The mixins are separate from the is_a hierarchy and the mixin classes do not contribute to a classes inheritance hierarchy. Identification, Description, and Indexing Related Slots \u00b6 aliases \u00b6 The aliases slot can be used to define a list of aliases for a class (or slot). This is useful for adding synonymous names to your class (or slot). description \u00b6 The description slot can be used to provide a human-readable description of a class (or slot). slot_uri \u00b6 The slot_uri slot can be used to define a canonical URI that is the true representation for that particular slot. That is, the value of slot_uri can be used interchangably with the slot being defined. in_subset \u00b6 The in_subset slot can be used tag your class (or slot) to belong to a pre-defined subset. The actual subset names are defined as part of the Schema definition. id_prefixes \u00b6 The id_prefixes slot can be used to define a list of valid ID prefixes that instances of this class ought to have as part of their CURIE. The order of the list matters since its a prioritized list where the prefix with the highest priority appears at the top of the list. Class Composition Related Slots \u00b6 slots \u00b6 The slots property enumerates the names of slots which a given class, mixin, or its subclasses are generally permitted to have. Unless it is designated as one of the defining_slots , or slot_usage specifies that a given slot is required, then it is not mandatory that such a slot is instantiated in all instances of the given class, mixin, or its subclasses. defining_slots \u00b6 The defining_slots slot can be used to specify which slots of an instance are necessary for defining an instance as a member of a class. Listing a slot as one of the defining_slots slots effectively makes it a required slot. slot_usage \u00b6 The slot_usage slot can be used to specify how a particular slot ought to be used in a class. This is useful for documenting what a particular slot means for instances of a particular class. In the slot_usage section we define the range and provide a description for the slot's subject and object , to better document what entities this slot is supposed to link. required \u00b6 The required slot can be used to define whether a slot is required. When a slot is declared as required, via required: true , any class that uses that slot must have a value for that slot. Slots Related to Constraints on Slot Composition \u00b6 domain \u00b6 The domain slot mimics the idea of rdfs:domain where you constrain the type of classes that a given slot can be a part of. range \u00b6 The range slot mimics the idea of rdfs:range where you can constrain the type of classes (or data types) a given slot can have as its value. Slots Related to Semantic Mappings \u00b6 exact_mappings \u00b6 The exact_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be exact mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. close_mappings \u00b6 The close_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be close mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. narrow_mappings \u00b6 The narrow_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be narrow mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. broad_mappings \u00b6 The broad_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be broad mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. related_mappings \u00b6 The related_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be related mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. Determining the granularity of mappings \u00b6 What does it mean for an external concept to be one of related_mappings , broad_mappings , narrow_mappings , close_mappings , exact_mappings ? Here is an decision tree that will help you determine the granularity of your mappings: An external concept can be considered as an exact mapping to class or slot if the former can be used interchangeably with the latter. That is, the semantics are identical and any transitive property that the external concept might bring into the model must not violate the internal consistency of the model. If it is difficult to determine if an external concept can be considered an exact mapping then it is much safer to treat it as a close mapping If an external concept can be treated a sub-class of the class or slot then it can be treated as a narrow mapping If an external concept can be treated as a super-class of the class or slot then it can be treated as a broad mapping If an external concept is distantly related to a class or slot then it can be treated as a related mapping","title":"LinkML Quickstart Guide"},{"location":"linkml-quickstart/#quickstart-guide-for-using-linkml","text":"","title":"Quickstart guide for using LinkML"},{"location":"linkml-quickstart/#overview","text":"The LinkML framework provides a variety of idioms, called slots, to define the semantics of classes and slots.

Thesaurus : A Thesaurus is a form of controlled vocabulary that provides a dictionary of synonyms, near-synonyms, and other semantically related terms to facilitate unambiguous interpretation of terms or concepts. Ontology : An ontology is a formal specification of concepts, from a particular domain of knowledge, that are arranged in a hierarchy, as a directed acyclic graph, where concepts are defined in relation to other concepts in the graph. In the biological and biomedical domain, knowledge is organized in various forms. Some are human readable, some are machine readable, while seldom few are both human and machine readable. Of the many forms of knowledge representation, ontologies have been gaining popularity with several domain specific ontologies being developed in the last two decades. The most familiar one is the Gene Ontology that describes functions of gene products. OBO Foundry : The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry is a community for developing interoperable ontologies that are logically well-formed and scientifically accurate. They do so by putting forth a set of design principles that promotes open-use, collaborative development, well defined scope, common syntax, and relations. All the well known ontologies are catalogued in the OBO Foundry. Why reference external resources? \u00b6 In the presence of well developed, curated, and maintained resources, it is crucial that new projects and initiatives be aware of these resources before developing new ones. When developing a new data model or schema, there will always be a need to be semantically precise. While one can achieve precision by being verbose with their model, it is immensely beneficial to map elements in their model to other controlled vocabularies, thesauri, and ontologies. In the case of GHGA Metadata Schema following are a few reasons why mapping to external semantic resources would be useful: To define our concepts (or classes) in relation to other concepts which are well defined, richly annotated, and widely used To achieve semantic clarity and consistency where when we define a class as equivalent to a term in an ontology, we are making a statement that the class is identical in its meaning, not just by its lexical definition but also by its semantic structure To be able to translate external heterogenous data onto our schema by the way of mappings To be able to translate our data to external data models by the way of mappings How to reference an external concept or term \u00b6 There are a few things to keep in mind before defining mappings in the GHGA Metadata Schema. URI : A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a sequence of characters that can be used to to identify an abstract or a physical resource. URIs can be used to identify real world objects, concepts, or information resources. URIs are used by web browsers and are also used to identify any resource described using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). IRI : An Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) is an extension to a URI where the sequence of characters are expanded to include international characters. CURIE : A Compact Uniform Resource Identifier (CURIE) is an abbreviated representation of a URI/IRI. Such representations are common when describing resources in RDF, which includes ontologies. A CURIE is generated by first defining a mapping between the IRI and a short prefix. Such a mapping is called a prefix mapping. For example, www.example.com can be mapped to ex . Systems that are aware of this prefix mapping can then contract IRIs that have www.example.com in it. For example, www.example.com/foo can be contracted to its CURIE representation of ex:foo Defining prefix to IRI mappings Before we reference external resources, it is crucial that we define the IRI to prefix mappings for those resources. Lets say we want to map a class in our schema to the Experiment Factor Ontology . First, we need to check if there exists a mapping from an IRI to the prefix EFO in our default CURI maps (defined via default_curi_maps in the schema YAML). If not, then we should define a mapping in the prefixes block. But what is the base IRI for EFO? Lets say we want to map a class to the term EFO:0000311 cancer , and the actual IRI for this term is http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000311 . Here, the base IRI would be http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_ , such that when this IRI is contracted to the EFO prefix, we get EFO:0000311 . Most of the prefix to IRI mappings are already defined by other open-source initiatives like: Prefix Commons Registry Bioregistry And these mappings exist in a JSON-LD file. Use the defined prefix Once the prefix mapping is defined, use the CURIE form of the concept or term as reference in the GHGA Metadata Schema.","title":"Referencing Ontologies"},{"location":"referencing-ontologies/#referencing-ontologies-controlled-vocabularies-and-thesauri","text":"","title":"Referencing Ontologies, Controlled Vocabularies, and Thesauri"},{"location":"referencing-ontologies/#basics","text":"Controlled Vocabulary : A Controlled Vocabulary is an organized selection of words or phrases that are used to tag pieces of information.

Here, the base IRI would be http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_ , such that when this IRI is contracted to the EFO prefix, we get EFO:0000311 . Most of the prefix to IRI mappings are already defined by other open-source initiatives like: Prefix Commons Registry Bioregistry And these mappings exist in a JSON-LD file. Use the defined prefix Once the prefix mapping is defined, use the CURIE form of the concept or term as reference in the GHGA Metadata Schema.","title":"How to reference an external concept or term"},{"location":"release-process/","text":"Release Process \u00b6 This section is relevant to core developers who are responsible for making stable releases of the schema and its artifacts.
